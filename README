Small private fantasy motorsport league. Writen for use with my friends. Currently a work in progress.  

Costs
-----
The costs of drivers, like last year will be based off of the betting odds of winning the championship. 
The teams will be ordered by the sum of the drivers driving them - or maybe the betting odds. I've not decided yet. 

Scoring
-------
Same as last year. 

Users
-----
Make these with the console script. 

Calendar
--------
Built from an ICS file I exported from google, imported with the cosnole script. 


TODO
----
* Get functionality to match last years python effort. 
* Implement predictions
* Allow visualisation of score breakdown
* Graphs!
